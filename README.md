# Django Project for Real Estate Seller Web Page

_Its a Django Practice Project_

## About

Its a web page where you can view some information and picture about houses. 
(Next part of this about will be updated after completing the project)
its a practice project with Udemy course. Here I used djnago to cmplete the backend part.
Please Note that its not an open source project. Because its html and css part is not developed by me.
But soon I'll replace that part using ReactJS and then
I'll make it open source.
Thank you for your time.
